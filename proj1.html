    <h2>Project 1</h2>
    <h1>Video as a Cultural Critique</h1>
	  <h3>Assignment summary</h3>
    <p>Make a video that is in dialogue with the history and trajectory of video art. Over the last 60 years, artists have used video and digital media as tools for challenging cultural norms, exploring personal identity, unpacking politics of representation, and experimenting with potential use (and misuse) of new technologies. Students may apply these trends to our current cultural moment, looking at videoâ€™s role in surveillance, sousveillance, YouTube, social media, and activism.</p>

	  	  <h3>Requirements:</h3>
<p><ul>
	  <li>Original footage</li>
	  <li>2-5 minutes</li>
	  <li>Vision for how this would be presented: ie. on Vimeo or YouTube, as a series of Instagram posts, in a gallery installation, for a theater environment, projected on a building, etc. </li>
	  </ul></p>
