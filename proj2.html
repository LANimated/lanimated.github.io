    <h2>Project 2</h2>
    <h1>Video as an Installation</h1>
	  <h3>Assignment summary</h3>
    <p>Create video for a gallery environment. How might video create an immersive environment, integrate with sculpture, have multiple channels playing simultaneously, accompany performance, or incorporate live feeds of the room? This could be an installation involving projection mapping, sculpture, performance, multi-channel video, etc.</p>

	  <h3>Requirements:</h3>
<p><ul>
	  <li>Minimum 2 minute video</li>
	  <li>Vision for installation experience</li>
	  <li>Presentation of props, models, and/or designs for installation if not physically possible</li></ul></p>
	  <h3>About the video</h3>
<p>We are very used to technology around us. Its not uncommon to see someone texting and walking or lounging or skating or eating or doing lifts. At this point you see people get into really weird positions. People dangle their phones to get better signal or set their laptops sideways so they can watch while laying down in bed. This mock-up simulation of an installation has monitors set up in different positions and orientations. All of these positions are representations of positions I have seen people in as they watch on their devices. The experiment is to see if people would position themselves in order to watch the video playing on these monitors. </p>
